// A binary tree is an efficient data structure for fast data 
// storage and retrieval due to its O(log N) runtime. 

// It is a specialized tree data structure that is made up of a root node, 
// and at most two child branches or subtrees. 
// Each child node is itself a binary tree.

// Each node has the following properties:
// -- data
// -- a depth value, where depth of 1 indicates the top level of the tree and 
//      a depth greater than 1 is a level somewhere lower in the tree
// -- a left pointer that points to a left child which is itself a binary tree, 
//      and must have a data lesser than the root node’s data
// -- a right pointer that points to a right child which is itself a binary tree,
//       and must have a data greater than the root node’s data
